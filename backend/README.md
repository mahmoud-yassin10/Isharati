## Project Overview

The backend combines:

- **Computer Vision** for sign-video preprocessing and pose/keypoint extraction.
- **Deep Learning** for sign recognition from processed pose features.
- **Arabic NLP** for converting raw predicted glosses into more natural Egyptian Arabic sentences.
- **Pose retrieval and smoothing** for generating sign-language motion from Arabic text or speech.
- **Cloudinary integration** for storing generated `.pose` files and serving them to the frontend.

This API is designed to be used with a web frontend where users can:

1. Enter Arabic text and receive a sign animation.
2. Upload Arabic speech and receive a sign animation.
3. Upload a sign-language video and receive Arabic text.
4. Upload a full sentence video and receive a cleaned Arabic sentence.

## Requirements

- Python **3.10+** recommended.
- FFmpeg support through `imageio-ffmpeg`.
- Cloudinary account for generated pose file storage.
- OpenRouter API key for optional Arabic NLP refinement.
- Trained sign-recognition model files inside the `models/` directory.

GPU is recommended for sign-video inference. The API can run on CPU, but video processing and model inference may be slow.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Cloudinary

NLP_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o-mini
OPENROUTER_REFERER=https://your-app-url.com
OPENROUTER_TITLE=Isharati
```

Never commit the real `.env` file to GitHub.

---

## Model Files

The sign-recognition service expects model files in the `models/` folder.

Common expected files:

```text
models/
├── best_model.pt or best_model.pth
├── label_map.csv or label_map_used.csv
├── training_config.json
├── aux_10A_mean.npy
├── aux_10A_std.npy
└── aux_10A_names.json
```

Large model files should not be committed directly to GitHub if they exceed GitHub limits. Use one of these options instead:

- Git LFS.
- Cloud storage download script.
- Release assets.
- Private deployment storage.

---

## Deployment Notes

### Fly.io (Raqeeb API)

Config lives at the repo root: `fly.toml` + `backend/Dockerfile`. The image installs a slim `requirements-fly.txt` (lessons, auth, text-to-sign, MP4). Sign-to-text / Torch stay off this machine.

From the repo root, with [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/) installed:

```bash
fly auth login
fly apps create raqeeb-api --org personal
fly volumes create raqeeb_data --region fra --size 1 --app raqeeb-api
fly secrets set --app raqeeb-api RAQEEB_JWT_SECRET="replace-me" CORS_ORIGINS="https://your-frontend.vercel.app"
fly deploy
```

If `raqeeb-api` is taken, change `app` in `fly.toml` and the `--app` flags. Health check: `https://raqeeb-api.fly.dev/health`.

On demo day set `min_machines_running = 1` in `fly.toml` (or `fly scale count 1`) so the first student request is not a cold start.

Then point Vercel `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` at `https://raqeeb-api.fly.dev` and rebuild.

For production deployment:

- Use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets.
- Keep `.env` out of GitHub.
- Use HTTPS for camera access in the frontend.
- Run the API behind a reverse proxy or managed cloud service.
- Increase request timeout for video inference endpoints.
- Prefer GPU hosting for sign-video recognition.
- Store generated media in Cloudinary or another object storage service.

Example production command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `OPENROUTER_API_KEY not found`

The NLP refinement will be disabled or fail if the key is missing. Add it to `.env` or set `use_nlp=false` when testing sign-to-text endpoints.

### Cloudinary upload fails

Check these variables:

```env
CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUD_API_KEY=
CLOUD_API_SECRET=
```

Also make sure the Cloudinary account allows raw file uploads.

### Video generated but browser shows 0 seconds

The animation generator converts the output to H.264 MP4 using `imageio-ffmpeg`. Make sure `imageio-ffmpeg` is installed and the server has permission to create temporary files.

### Sign-to-text is slow

CPU inference can be slow. Use CUDA/GPU where possible and reduce `max_segments` for full-sentence videos.

---

## Future Work

- Add a 3D avatar instead of skeleton visualization.
- Extend the supported Arabic/Egyptian Sign Language vocabulary.
- Improve full sentence recognition using motion-based segmentation.
- Add real-time motion trigger to avoid predicting while the user is not signing.
- Improve frontend playback using a dedicated pose/animation viewer.
- Add API authentication using an `x-api-key` header.
- Add Docker support for easier deployment.

## Team / Credits

This backend was developed as part of the **Isharati** graduation project, combining computer vision, deep learning, Arabic NLP, and cloud deployment to make Arabic sign-language translation more accessible.
